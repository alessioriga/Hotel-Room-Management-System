# HOTEL-ROOM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

## Problem Statement

Hotels often struggle with managing room availability, bookings, and customer records using manual or fragmented systems. This leads to inefficiencies, double bookings, and poor customer experience.  

## Proposed Solution

This project introduces a web-based Hotel Rooms Management System that centralises room availability, customer records, and booking operations into one streamlined platform. Built with Python, Flask, and SQLite, the system is designed with modular architecture to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability.  

Staff can efficiently manage reservations, update room statuses, and generate billing information through a simple, user-friendly interface. The solution reduces human error, improves operational efficiency, and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements such as reporting, payment tracking, and role-based access control.

## Key Features

- **Room Management**: Add, update, and track room details (type, price, availability).
- **Customer Management**: Store customer information and link them to bookings.
- **Booking System**: Book rooms with check-in/check-out dates and prevent double bookings.
- **Billing**: Automatically calculate total cost based on stay duration and room rate.
- **Admin Dashboard**: View all bookings, search/filter data, and manage rooms.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS for structuring and styling the user interface.
* **Backend:** Python with Flask as web framework.
* **Database:** *SQLite for lightweight, file-based data storage.
* **Version Control:** Git Hub for source code management.

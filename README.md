# HOTEL-ROOM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

## Problem Statement



## Proposed Solution

Develop a lightweight, modular Hotel Rooms Management System that centralises room inventory, customer data, and booking operations. The system will streamline daily operations, reduce human error, and provide a foundation for future enhancements like reporting and payment tracking.


## Key Features

- **Room Management**: Add, update, and track room details (type, price, availability).
- **Customer Management**: Store customer information and link them to bookings.
- **Booking System**: Book rooms with check-in/check-out dates and prevent double bookings.
- **Billing**: Automatically calculate total cost based on stay duration and room rate.
- **Admin Dashboard**: View all bookings, search/filter data, and manage rooms.


## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS for structuring and styling the user interface.
* **Backend:** Python with Flask as web framework.
* **Database:** *SQLite for lightweight, file-based data storage.
* **Version Control:** Git Hub for source code management.
